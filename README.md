# CleanYouTube

CleanYouTube is a lightweight Userscript that transforms YouTube into a distraction-free environment. It removes the algorithmic feed, cleans up the search interface, and centers the content for a focused viewing experience.

## Features

- **Minimalist Homepage**: Replaces the chaotic feed with a clean, centered search bar and logo – just like Google Search.
- **Focused Search Results and Channel Pages**: Displays video results without clutter, removing shorts shelves, chips, and sidebar distractions.

## Installation

Since this is a specific Userscript, you need a Userscript manager for your browser.

1. Install the **Tampermonkey** browser extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2. **[Click here to install the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukas-hzb/CleanYouTube/main/clean_youtube.user.js)**.
3. Tampermonkey will ask if you want to add the script. Confirm by clicking "Install".
4. Open YouTube – the clean interface should appear automatically.

## Works Best With

This script focuses on layout cleanup. For a complete distraction-free experience, I recommend pairing it with:

- **[AdBlock for YouTube™](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adblock-for-youtube/cmedhionkhpnakcndndgjdbohmhepckk?hl=en-US)** - Removes video ads.
- **[SocialFocus — Hide Feeds](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/socialfocus-%E2%80%94-hide-feeds/abocjojdmemdpiffeadpdnicnlhcndcg?hl=en-US)** - Hides Shorts, recommendations, and other distractions.
