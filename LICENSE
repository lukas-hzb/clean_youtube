2. ACCEPTANCE / FORMATION OF CONTRACT
2.1 This Agreement is an offer by Licensor. A binding license is formed when Licensee accepts by (i) downloading, cloning, copying, installing, or using the Software, in whole or in part; or (ii) clicking an express "I accept" or equivalent control.
2.2 By using the Software, Licensee confirms full acceptance of this Agreement.

3. GRANT OF LICENSE — BROAD PERSONAL & EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS
3.1 Subject to strict compliance with the exclusion in Section 6, Licensor grants Licensee a revocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to:
   (a) usage: access, download, run, and use the Software for any Personal & Educational Use;
   (b) modification: inspect, modify, adapt, and build upon the source code ("Modifications") for any Personal & Educational Use; and
   (c) distribution: share, copy, and distribute the Software and Modifications solely for Personal & Educational Use, provided this License Agreement accompanies any distribution.
3.2 The usage, modification, and distribution for strictly personal or educational purposes are permitted in any form (binary or source), provided they remain non-commercial.

4. RESTRICTIONS
4.1 No Commercial Use: Any commercial use — including but not limited to resale, provision of paid services, monetization, internal business operations, or licensing for a fee — is strictly prohibited absent a separate, written commercial license executed by Licensor.
4.2 Excluded Person: The Licensee acts as a gatekeeper against the Excluded Person. The Licensee shall not knowingly distribute, share, or make the Software available to the Excluded Person defined in Section 1.5.

5. THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS & WAIVER OF CLAIMS
5.1 Waiver of Third-Party Rights: Unlike strict proprietary licenses, Licensor explicitly waives any claim of ownership over materials, code, libraries, or intellectual property created or owned by third parties ("Third-Party Materials") that may be included in or distributed with the Software.
5.2 Ownership of Modifications: Licensor waives any claim to ownership of Modifications created by Licensee. Licensee retains full ownership of their own modifications, subject only to the underlying rights of the Software required to operate the code.
5.3 No Contributor License Agreement (CLA): Contributors are not required to transfer copyright to Licensor. By submitting contributions, Licensee merely grants Licensor a non-exclusive right to use the contribution within the Software.

6. SPECIFIC PERSONAL EXCLUSION — STRICT ENFORCEMENT
6.1 Absolute Exclusion: Notwithstanding the broad permissions in Section 3, NO license, permission, authorization, or right of any kind is granted to the Excluded Person (Daniel Harzbecker). Use by the Excluded Person remains strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement.
6.2 Representation: By accepting this Agreement, Licensee warrants that Licensee is not the Excluded Person and is not acting on behalf of the Excluded Person.
6.3 Enforcement: Licensor reserves the right to employ technical and legal measures to prevent the Excluded Person from accessing the Software. If Licensor determines that the Excluded Person is benefiting from the Software via a proxy, the license granted to that proxy is automatically void.
6.4 Duty to Protect: Licensee agrees not to assist the Excluded Person in circumventing this ban.

7. COMPATIBILITY & PUBLIC HOSTING
7.1 Public Forks Allowed: In contrast to strict proprietary terms, Licensee is permitted to create public forks or mirrors of the Software for educational or personal collaboration, provided the repository clearly indicates the non-commercial nature of the license and retains the exclusion of the person named in Section 6.

8. OWNERSHIP
8.1 Core Ownership: Title and intellectual property rights in the original Software remain with Licensor.
8.2 Disclaimer of Third-Party Rights: Licensor asserts no ownership over third-party dependencies, bundled assets not created by Licensor, or community contributions, which remain the property of their respective authors.

9. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER & LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
9.1 No Warranty: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
9.2 Limitation of Liability: To the extent permitted by applicable law, Licensor is liable only for willful misconduct and gross negligence. Liability for slight negligence, fitness for a particular purpose, or third-party claims is excluded.

10. TERM AND TERMINATION
10.1 This Agreement is effective until terminated.
10.2 Licensor may terminate the license specifically if Licensee breaches Section 4.1 (Commercial Use) or Section 6 (Excluded Person).
10.3 Upon termination, Licensee must cease use of the Software.

11. GOVERNING LAW & JURISDICTION
